# IntroToQt

Qt is a cross-platform framework for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and applications in C++. It was originally developed by Trolltech in 1995, and is now owned by The Qt Company.

Qt provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for creating native-looking applications on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and various embedded systems. It includes a variety of graphical widgets for building user interfaces, as well as support for multimedia, networking, and database operations.

One of the key benefits of using Qt is its ability to abstract away platform-specific details, allowing developers to write code that works across multiple operating systems without the need for extensive modifications. Additionally, Qt provides support for the development of mobile applications for iOS and Android through the Qt for Mobile platforms.

Qt is widely used in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, medical devices, and gaming. It is also commonly used in the development of desktop applications, particularly in the open source community.
